## What is a object in java script ?
### n JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.Everything is an object in JavaScript.

## How the this keyword works
### The this keyword in JavaScript behaves a little differently compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode. In most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It canâ€™t be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called.
